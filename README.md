# Sentiment-Classification-using-BERT-Traditional-ML
Built an end-to-end sentiment analysis pipeline on 42K+ comments using BERT (87% accuracy, F1 0.86) and baseline ML models. Applied SpaCy/NLTK preprocessing, TF-IDF vectorization, and GPU-accelerated mixed-precision training. Enhanced insights with NER and visualized results using confusion matrices and class distribution plots.
