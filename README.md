# üßæ Sentiment Classification using BERT and Traditional ML

An end-to-end sentiment analysis pipeline built on 42K+ comments utilizing BERT for deep learning and traditional machine learning models. Achieved an accuracy of 87% and an F1 score of 0.86. The project includes preprocessing with SpaCy/NLTK, TF-IDF vectorization, and GPU-accelerated mixed-precision training.

## üìå Features
